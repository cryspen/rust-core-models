# rust-core-models

A model of Rust's `core` and `alloc` libraries, packaged as:

1. **Rust crates** (`core-models`, `alloc`, `rust_primitives`) that mirror the
   `core::*` and `alloc::*` items downstream verified-Rust code uses.
2. A **Lean library** (`CoreModels`) extracted from those crates by
   [Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas), suitable for
   downstream Aeneas-extracted Lean projects to depend on as a drop-in
   `core` model.
3. A **test suite** (`tests/`) split into two surfaces:
   - `tests/client_test/` — a regression "client" crate that exercises
     items from `core::*` / `std::*` end-to-end. Its only assertion is
     that the Aeneas extraction of the crate elaborates against our
     `CoreModels` shims; it does not check behavioural agreement.
   - `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/` — a **rust↔lean equivalence**
     framework. Each test pins one concrete behavioural observation
     (e.g. `Some(7u8).is_some() == true`), checked once on the Rust
     side via `cargo test` and once on the Lean side via a `#guard`
     against the Aeneas extraction. Divergence between Rust std and
     our model surfaces here.

## Why this exists

Verified-Rust pipelines need a model of `core` and `alloc` to elaborate
against. Writing that model in Rust (rather than directly in each
verification tool's logic) has three advantages:

- **Easy to extend**: adding a new `core::*` item is just a Rust source
  edit, no proof-assistant boilerplate.
- **Cross-testable against the real Rust core library**: the model is
  ordinary Rust, so we can compile and run it side-by-side with `std`
  and check behavioral agreement.
- **Shareable across verification tools**: a single Rust model feeds
  multiple downstream backends — currently hax-F\*, hax-Lean, and
  Aeneas-Lean — instead of each tool maintaining its own shadow `core`.

CI verifies that the *committed* extracted Lean files in
`lean/CoreModels/{Funs,Types,…}.lean` match what a fresh extraction produces
against the pinned toolchain. That means a downstream Lean consumer can
just `lake update` this repo without installing the Rust toolchain.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- `charon` and `aeneas` on `PATH` (the upstream nix flakes are the
  recommended build path; CI uses `nix build github:AeneasVerif/{charon,aeneas}`).
  Override the Makefile lookup with `make CHARON=/path/to/charon AENEAS=/path/to/aeneas`.
- [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) for Lean.

### Targets

```sh
make lean           # extract Rust → Lean, patch, build the Aeneas library
make tests          # full test suite (both client_test/ and rust_lean_equiv_test/)

make clean          # remove all generated Lean + LLBC, keep hand-written
```

`make lean` is idempotent: re-running without source changes is a no-op
modulo Lake's incremental build.

To run just one test surface in isolation:

```sh
make -C tests/client_test            # smoke-test extraction
make -C tests/rust_lean_equiv_test   # rust↔lean equivalence
```

## Testing

### Two test surfaces

**`tests/client_test/`** is a "what a downstream user touches" probe.
Its `src/lib.rs` calls a representative slice of `core::*` / `std::*`
items; the test passes iff Aeneas can extract the resulting LLBC and
the result elaborates against our `CoreModels` shims. Failures here
mean *the extraction pipeline is broken* for some surface — they say
nothing about whether Rust and Lean agree behaviourally.

**`tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/`** is the **rust↔lean equivalence
framework**. Each test pins one concrete observation and checks it
twice:

- **Rust side** — `cargo test` runs every `#[rust_lean_test] pub fn
  test_xxx() -> bool { ... }`, generated by the
  `rust_lean_test_macro` crate, and asserts the body returns `true`.
- **Lean side** — `gen_lean_tests.py` scans `source/src/**/*.rs` for
  the same attribute, finds each function's Aeneas-emitted name in
  `Funs.lean`, and emits one
  `#guard <fully-qualified-name> == .ok true` into
  `lean/RustLeanTests/LeanTests.lean`. Lake fails the build for any
  guard whose Aeneas-evaluated body is not `Result.ok true`.

Both halves must pass. Together they say: "for this concrete input,
Rust std and the Lean translation of `core_models` give the same
answer." Disagreements show up as a failed `#guard` (Lean side knows
the truth) or a failed `cargo test` assertion (Rust side knows the
truth) — same code, different oracle.

### Adding a new item to the model

When you add an item to `core-models/src/core/foo.rs` (or `alloc/src/...`):

1. **Add one property-based test** (`proptest!`) in the same file's
   `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block. This is the broad
   randomized check that the model matches Rust std across the input
   domain.
2. **Add several point tests** in
   `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/source/src/{core,alloc}/foo.rs`
   (mirroring the source file's path under `core-models/`). Each
   point test pins one concrete behaviour with a `#[rust_lean_test]`
   attribute. Cover boundaries: zero, `MIN`, `MAX`, empty, single
   element, signed/unsigned edges, the `None`/`Err` case, etc.

The point tests in (2) are what catch *extraction* bugs — the
property-based test in (1) only knows about Rust, while the
equivalence test exercises Aeneas's translation of the same item.

#### Pitfalls

- **Typed `None`**: Aeneas drops the `T` parameter of `None::<T>` in
  zero-arg functions, leaving `Option.None` polymorphic in the
  extracted Lean. Use the helpers in
  `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/source/src/helpers.rs`
  (`none_u8`, `none_i32`, …) rather than inline `None`. Add a
  `none_<T>` if your type isn't covered.
- **Closures**: tests that rely on `|x| ...` (e.g. `map`,
  `and_then`, `unwrap_or_else`) currently extract poorly. Comment
  them out with `// TODO(closure-extraction): ...`.
- **Excluded items**: things listed in `CHARON_EXCLUDES` /
  `ALLOC_CHARON_EXCLUDES` (`core::mem::swap`, `core::slice::index::*`,
  most `Vec` indexing, `BinaryHeap`, …) come from hand-written Lean
  definitions in `lean/CoreModels/{Funs,Types}External.lean`. Their
  equivalence tests live in the same file as the rest of the items
  in the same module (e.g. `core::mem::swap` tests live in
  `source/src/core/mem.rs`) — flagged with a section header noting
  they exercise a manual Lean def.

## Using the Lean library downstream

Add to your downstream `lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "CoreModels"
git = "https://github.com/cryspen/rust-core-models"
rev = "COMMIT_HASH_HERE"
subDir = "lean"
```

Use aeneas with the `-core-models-lib` option (currently only available with the following aeneas branch: https://github.com/cryspen/aeneas/tree/core-models-option)

Then the Aeneas-extracted code that uses `std::*` types will resolve through this library's
`core.*` / `alloc.*` shims.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Please:
- Run `cargo fmt --all` and `make lean tests` before opening a PR (CI
  enforces both).
- For every new `core::*` / `alloc::*` item:
  - Add **one property-based test** in the model crate's `#[cfg(test)]`
    block (see existing `proptest!` blocks in
    `core-models/src/core/option.rs` etc. for the pattern).
  - Add **several `#[rust_lean_test]` point tests** in
    `tests/rust_lean_equiv_test/source/src/...` covering corner cases
    of the input. See the [Testing](#testing) section for the
    motivation and the pitfalls.
- If your item is excluded from extraction (added to
  `CHARON_EXCLUDES`), the equivalence tests still go in the file that
  mirrors the item's `core::*` / `alloc::*` location — flag them with
  a section header like
  `// ----- foo (manually defined in Lean, not extracted) -----` so a
  reader knows the Lean side is hitting a hand-written definition in
  `lean/CoreModels/FunsExternal.lean` rather than the extraction.
